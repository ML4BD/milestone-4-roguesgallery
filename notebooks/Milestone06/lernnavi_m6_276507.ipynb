    "To this end, we **pre-processed** the data by removing students identified as inactive using criteria such as least number of actions per week. Then we selected a subset of features for each student and transformed their data into time series.<br>\n",
    "In an attempt to see if **regularity** helped categorize students into subgroups, we followed the procedure of [Shirvani Boroujeni, et al](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/218657/files/) to compute regularity features on online learning time series. We then clustered the students using the regularity metrics.<br>\n",
    "Finally, we trained multiple time series **classifiers** to predict wether a student would pass a level check or not. One classifier was trained per cluster and one over the whole data. We used 2 different classification techniques."

For this, we clustered with respect to time-agnostic metrics and then classified the time series.\n",
