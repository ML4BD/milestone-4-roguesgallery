\begin{abstract}
In this report, we present the results of a learning analytics study. The data analysed are produced by chronologically recorded clickstreams of Swiss secondary school student usage of the online maths and German learning platform Lernnavi. We quantify student behavioural patterns, in particular their regularity, and use these features to predict student attainment on the platform through a supervised learning pipeline. Our results reinforce that regular and persistent usage of the platform leads to better performance, however our models also serve to highlight some of the pitfalls of aiming to study human behaviour through opaque clickstreams.

\section{Introduction}
Improved digital technologies have made online learning formats such as MOOCs and dedicated learning platforms such as Moodle more accessible. Lernnavi is one of these online education platforms, whose primary use is as an accompanying teaching and learning tool in secondary education. They offer maths and German lessons and exercises. Students track their progress through a mastery score updated by so-called \textbf{level checks}, unique to each topic taught on the platform. 

\subsection{Research Question}

Innately, we are all aware of the fact that self-improvement demands commitment. This notion is omnipresent in education and is a persistent device used by educators to encourage learning. Consequently, we anticipate that students who choose (or are perhaps forced) to exhibit regular, recurrent patterns of learning behaviours will experience greater learning gains in the long-run. In this project, we wish to discover if this phenomenon is present within the Lernnavi environment, while going to a step further and identify which specific behaviours \textit{may} lead to higher attainment for a given student. In light of this, we state our research question:

\begin{displayquote}
\textit{Is it possible to identify one or more studying behaviors leading to a significant improvement in level check results?}
\end{displayquote}

\subsection{A1}
{\color{red}Description of methodology.}
Clustering is performed based on a set of time agnostic features for each user. These features include: counts of each significant action (an action with a transaction token); length of time on the platform, and a set of so-called \textbf{regularity} features. The latter is a set of metrics which measure to what extent user patterns repeat of chosen time periods, for example over hours of the day, days of the week, or weeks of the month. For instance, one feature, \texttt{PDH} -- an abbreviation of \textit{peak on day hour} -- measures if a users activity is concentrated around certain times of the day, based on the entropy of the histogram of the user's daily activity. We refer the reader to \cite{quantifyreg} to find a detailed description of all of the features.

{\color{red}Clustering...}

A decision tree classifier based on behavioural features was chosen due to the very interpretable nature of such a model. Indeed, it allows for the categorisation of students based on quantitative metrics on usage of the platform, while also ranking the importance of the behavioural features, which help us in answering our research question. 

Let $N$ be the number of users and $L_i$ be the number of level checks user $i$ has completed. For every $i \in N$ and $j \in L_i$, the data fed into the decision tree classifier is a vector $x_i^j = (x_{i1}^j, x_{i2}^j, \ldots, x_{i6}^j)$ where $x_{i1}$ is a positive integer, $x_{ik}$ for $k=2,3,4$ is a positive real number and $x_{i6} \in \{0,1\}$. The features $x_{ik}$ for $k=1,\ldots, 6$ are listed in Table 
\ref{tab:A2features}. Mention/describe: {\color{red}Regularity features...}. An `engagement score`, inspired by \cite{student_engagement}, recors whether a student demonstrated that they performed activities directly related to learning (submitting answers to questions and going to theory sections of the app) more than other students. To quantify this, if for a given user, the two aforementioned actions comprised more than $25\%$ of all actions recorded in $\texttt{num\_actions\_per\_week}$, then they were given an engagement score of $1$ and $0$ otherwise. We remark that each of these features aim to quantify some form of consistent behavioural pattern on the platform, ranging from simply being present on the platform, to using it in a repeated manner over a long period of time. 

\section{Results}

\subsection{Experimental Evaluation}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the
``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \TeX\ installation should include
this set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The
``\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\verb|ltimes|'' packages should not be used,
as they will override the built-in typeface families.

\section{Discussion}

Our results demonstrate that differing patterns of student behaviours certainly influence their performance on the platform. Even as we could not identify a specific optimal behavior, both experiments clearly demonstrated its potential by giving good prediction accuracy. We believe that in future work, this platform could be used to carry out directed causal experiments where students demonstrate explicit patterns and use the technology to study what brings about student success.


The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
\url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
{\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.

If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used
in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title|
command has a ``short title'' parameter:
\begin{verbatim}
  \title[short title]{full title}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Conclusions and Future Works}

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
identification.  As an exception, multiple authors may share one
affiliation. Authors' names should not be abbreviated; use full first
names wherever possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever
possible.

Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail
alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:
\begin{verbatim}
  \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
  \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
  \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note
to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors
of an article contributed equally to the work.

If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of
the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
overlapping text. The following command should be placed just after
the last \verb|\author{}| definition:
\begin{verbatim}
  \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
\end{verbatim}
Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all
of the authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the
page headers.

The article template's documentation, available at
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}, has a
complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective
use.

Note that authors' addresses are mandatory for journal articles.
